            It is not just about helping poor but also about saving kids <br>
            and adults from choosing ways which are unethical.<br>
            A number of criminals forced were forced to do what is <br>
            illegal and harmful for others. You can take an initiative<br>
            to prevent kids and other from walking on that road.<br>

            <h1>Help others in saving their lives:</h1>

            <p>Many patients lose their life because they cannot afford to<br>
            pay for expensive medical bills. Even though people are not<br>
            suffering from life-threatening diseases, they fail to pay <br>
            hospital bills and their situation get worse because of lack of<br>
            money. These financially disabled people need help so that they<br>
            can get a chance to survive.<br>
            You can work with an agency that works to help poor people.<br>
            You do not need to travel too far because you can find a<br>
            great organization online. It is obvious that many other people<br>
            are now coming forward to help poor individuals.<br>
            Their problems will be solved more quickly if you also join<br>
            the initiative of helping poor.<br>

            There are many benefits of helping the poor. Some people do it<br>
            because they want to spread smiles, some people do it because<br>
            they are really worried about helpless people, and some do it to <br>
            ensure everyone is happy and satisfied with what he has got.<br>
            Whatever the reason is, you should do good deeds<br>
            to be a better person. The amount you donate does not matter<br>
            because you can try whatever you can do in your capacity.<br>
